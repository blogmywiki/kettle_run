#Kettle Run

Can you do the Kettle Run in less than 12 parsecs?

Here's another Python game for the BBC MicroBit that's very easy for pupils to edit and improve.

The idea is that you navigate your ship through a canyon - or cave system or mountains. You can rotate your MicroBit through 90 degrees and fly up &amp; down or stay left and right. Use your imagination.

Use the A and B buttons to move left and right (or up and down), avoiding obstacles as you fly. If you hit anything it's GAME OVER and you press the reset button on the back to play again.

The aim is to get to your home port in order to put the kettle on for a nice cup of tea.

Complete 1 mission, and you go again - this time the game is faster and the terrain harder to navigate. Complete 5 and you win the game.

Hook a speaker or headphones up to pins 0 and GND for the audio experience.

There's loads of scope for students to make improvements to this game, simple or complex:
<ul>
	<li>Add more levels by changing <code>while level &lt; 6:</code> to a higher number.</li>
	<li>Make the game harder by speeding it up more on each level by making the number bigger in <code>speed -= 20</code></li>
	<li>Edit the terrain image to make it bigger or more challenging - the game should play as long as the image lasts.</li>
	<li>Perhaps add different terrains for different levels.</li>
	<li>Replace the button presses with tilt control of your ship.</li>
</ul>

#Kettle Run 2

This excting new version of the game features randomised terrain, longer runs on higher levels - and a lovely cup of tea!

This is a hex file of Kettle Run 2 you can drag straight onto your micro:bit - if you just want to play the game and don't want to know how it works or modify it.
